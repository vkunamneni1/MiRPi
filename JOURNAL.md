# 5/22/2025 Day 1: Research

Hello! This was Day 1 of MiRPi's development, and it was just research, research, research. I decided that I would use an IR Touch Frame (Touchscreen Panel) on top of a 2-way mirror panel on top of a monitor for the entire smart mirror system to work. Day 2 will be more technically focused, deciding on how I would design the system as a whole.

I also setup this GitHub repo to store this journal, all my source files, and eventually the BOM for MiRPi!
