# 5/22/2025 Day 1: Research

Hello! This was Day 1 of MiRPi's development, and it was just research, research, research. I decided that I would use an IR Touch Frame (Touchscreen Panel) on top of a 30% transparent mirror panel on top of a monitor for the entire smart mirror system to work. Day 2 will be more technically focused, deciding on how I would design the system as a whole.

I also setup this GitHub repo to store this journal, all my source files, and eventually the BOM for MiRPi!

**Total time spent: 1.5h**

# 5/22/2025 Day 2: Further Planning

Today, I decided that the mirror itself wasn't complex enough for Highway, so I did some thinking and came up with an idea. I was planning on putting LED strip lights behind the mirror to give it that "floating" effect, and I thought it would be cool if a custom PCB with a photoresistor could change the brightness and color of the lights (through emitting IR/RF) based on the amount of light in a room.

I also started to see if the parts I wanted to use were available online, and I was able to find relatively cheaper versions using Alibaba instead of Amazon.

**Total time spent: 2h**
